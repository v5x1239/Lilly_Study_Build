Apply workaround for CD-15376 as per below instructions.

1. Save the attached file to file system (CD-15376_detect.sql)
2. In a command window navigate to the directory where the files were saved
3. Connect to SQLPLUS as trial schema user and Execute CD-15376_detect.sql

            Example:  sqlplus <Trial UID>/<Trial PID>@<Connection String> @ CD-15376_detect.sql

       Note: An output file will be generated (CD-15376_fix.sql). Please attach this to the remedy ticket work info section.
